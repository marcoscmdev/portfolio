# My Portfolio – Work in Progress 🚧

Hi, I'm Marcos. I'm currently studying software development and training to become a multiplatform app developer (Web, iOS, Android, desktop or other emerging platforms) and, hopefully, a game developer too.

This repository is where I want to build a useful and honest portfolio.  
A way to document my journey and share what I learn along the way.

> 📝 This portfolio will eventually include full English versions of each section.  
> Until I reach a more stable professional stage, content will primarily be written in my native language (Spanish).

## 👀 What you'll find here

This portfolio is divided into several main sections:

- **About Me**: A dynamic kind of résumé where I show my education, experience, and what motivates me as a developer.

- **Projects**: My first real projects — some are rough, others more polished (but all honest). They are divided into three categories:

  - **Independent**: Personal ideas, small experiments, games, and apps I've built on my own to learn, explore, or simply for fun.

  - **From the Classroom**: Assignments and projects developed during my studies. Though they originate as academic exercises, I try to give them a personal and professional touch.

  - **Teamwork**: Collaborative projects. Here I’ve learned not only to code, but also to communicate, split tasks, and work with Git without chaos.

## 📌 Why this portfolio?

Because I want to work as a developer — that’s my main goal and the reason I'm fully committed to this path.

Because I’d love to work remotely for an international company, delivering value from anywhere while doing what I love.

Because this isn’t just about having a "nice repository" — it’s about showing my evolution, what I can do, and what I'm still learning.

## 🛠️ Tools and Tech I Use

- Swift + SwiftUI and Android Studio for mobile development  
- Java, PHP, JavaScript, and Python — languages I'm actively learning  
- Git + GitHub for version control  
- Markdown for documentation and note-taking  

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

This portfolio is meant to grow with my skills, interests, and curiosity.  
I'm especially interested in how to integrate AI into software development, explore cloud and enterprise technologies like AWS, and improve my knowledge of professional tools and best practices (testing, CI/CD, software architecture, etc).

🛠️ This portfolio is a living project — always evolving as I grow professionally.  
Not a static showcase, but an open window into my path as a developer.
